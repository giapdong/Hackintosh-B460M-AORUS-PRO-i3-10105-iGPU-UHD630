## CPU Support

- [x] Supports all 10-generation CPUs with UHD630 cores e.g: i3 10100, i5 10400, i5 10500...
- [x] The 10th generation CPU of non-core display with F can also have the following independent display without drive (but cannot use nuclear display acceleration)

## GPU Support

- [x] Support UHD630 graphics card with only CPU core display
- [x] Support AMD RX 470/480/570/570X/580/580X/590 series graphics cards. See also other hackintosh with this configuration [Here](https://github.com/giapdong/Hackintosh-Gigabyte-B460M-AORUS-PRO-i3-10100F-RX570)
- [x] Support AMD RX 5500/5600/5700 series graphics cards (dedicated config.plist required)
  > PS: To use the independent display, you need to forcibly turn on the CPU core display in the BIOS (Advanced -> Built-in display configuration -> Integrated graphics multi-monitor (IGD Multi-monitor) -> Allow), otherwise the core display hardware decoding will fail and only use the core Obviously can be ignored
